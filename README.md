Hello All, 
Please click on the link provided in the Readme for Demo.  
After clicking on the link you will be able to see steering wheel, accelerator pedal and break pedal at respective positions. Also note that Speedometer is at zero and fuel gauge is full. 

Start the car by double pressing “S”.
Once the engine is started you will be able to hear the engine roar and fuel gauge will be full. Also lookout for the green colour on the start button to indicate that the engine is in on condition. 

Meanwhile allow ‘location access’.

Press and hold “A” for acceleration.
You will be able to see the acceleration animations at the pedal and also speedometer increasing its speed.

In the dashboard you will be able to see the time on the top left and greetings message at the center and temperature at the top right.
The greetings at the centre will be based on the time.

The fuel gauge will gradually decrease when the car is in ON state. Also checkout the break animation in break pedal when “B” is pressed. When the break is applied you will be able to see the speedometer gradually decreasing its speed. 

In case you have given permission for location you will be able to see the map embedded at your location at the centre of the dashboard.  

Maneuver with left and right arrows of the keyboard. Enjoy the "power steering" effects of the steer wheel for a smooth experience.

Press “C” and allow camera access to use your device’s camera facility to live stream on the rear view mirror of the car. Again press “C” for stopping the live stream and turning off the camera.

Press “E” to hear a roaring effect while stopping the car. Notice that the colour of start/stop button will change to red and the display features in the dashboard will be turned off.

Look out for different animations apart from the aforementioned features. Thank You 🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗
